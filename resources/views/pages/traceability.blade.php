                                Since the 1st of April 2011, Rwanda led the way in implementing the regulations for upstream companies from mines to negociants, comptoirs and to smelters. This scheme was developed by ITRI (<b><em>International Tin Research Institute</em></b>) which is managed on the ground by iTSCi ( ITRI <b><em>Tin Supply Chain Initiative</em></b>) which is run by PACT.<br/><br/>
                                This follows the Dodd Frank Act US legislation on conflict minerals.<br/><br/>
                                MSA Ltd played a major role in assisting in implementing this scheme under the leadership of OGMR/GMD.<br/><br/>
                                The Chief Executif Officer of MSA as well as all staff members involved in the traceability process spend much time on addressing these new regulations on the national and on the international level. Although it has been a challenging period for all the related industries in the Great Lake Region during the transition phase of the minerals supply chain according to the due diligence requirements, Rwanda now is a leader in this process and is exporting only tagged minerals under the iTSCi and OECD scheme.<br/><br/>
                                Thanks to the extraordinary work by all parties involved in that process.<br/><br/>
                                MSA strongly believe that minerals traceability will curb conflicts minerals getting access to mineral supply chain of Rwanda.<br/><br/>
                                MSA efforts to cut with illegal trading of minerals were complimented by the UN panel of experts in the UN report of 2010 as per below quote found in the report:<br/><br/>

Those whom the Group denounced for fraud in previous reports have in the main begun trading legally, apparently at the instigation and with the financing of Rwanda-based Minerals Supply Africa (MSA), which is one of the main buyers of minerals from the eastern area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. MSA is the only buyer from nine comptoirs in North Kivu and the Bakulikira comptoir in SouthKivu, spending on the order of $5 million per month. MSA imported 1,945 tons of cassiterite from the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1 January and 31 July, according to Rwandan statistics (see annex 57).Encouragingly, these figures are nearly identical to the statistics given to the Group by the Congolese mine services concerning MSA.</p>

The Group has worked closely with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the issue of due diligence, and in particular with the Ministry of Mines. In addition, as requested by the Council in resolution 1896(2009), the Group has taken advantage of and participated in the work done in otherforums on this issue, including in particular the working group hosted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on due diligence guidelines for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the International Task Force on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the comptoir associations of North and SouthKivu, MSA and its suppliers, the Comimpa and Comider creuseurs associations,ITRI, the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative</p>
